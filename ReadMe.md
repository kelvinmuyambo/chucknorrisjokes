#Completed Full Stack C# Assessment


## Outstanding Work and Points of Improvement

Due to time constraints, the following could not be implemented

1. Implement State Management for Angular App
2. Unsubscribe from loose Observables to prevent memory leaks
3. Implement Dependancy Injection for the services into the API
4. Unit Tests not implemented at all, TDD usually best when time is available
5. Error Handling at API and Front end Level
6. Code clean up eg CategoriesService
7. Build and Publishing strategy
