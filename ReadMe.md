# Completed Full Stack C# Assessment


## Outstanding Work and Points of Improvement

Due to time constraints, the following could not be implemented

1. Unsubscribe from loose Observables to prevent memory leaks
2. Unit Tests not implemented at all, TDD usually best when time is available
3. Error Handling at API and Front end Level
4. Code clean up eg CategoriesService
5. Build and Publishing strategy
